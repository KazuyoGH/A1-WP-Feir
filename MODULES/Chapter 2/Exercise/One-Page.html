        <h3><i>From BigYeedus on Playsation Vita:</i></h3>
        <p>Absolutely bonkers from start to finish. The mystery solving is pretty 
            fun. Soundtrack full of bangers. Sometimes crosses a certain line of 
            taste and has a very particular sense of humor. If you can get on its 
            wavelength, you won't regret it.
        </p>

        <h3><i>From Twinfinite on PC:</i></h3>
        <p>Don’t be turned away by its linearity, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc 
            is one of the best visual novels you’ll play.
        </p>

        <h3><i>From Metro GameCentral on PC:</i></h3>
        <p>Don’t let the name or presentation put you off: this is an impressive 
            piece of interactive storytelling that gets more right than most other 
            games with 10 times its budget.
