        There's no need to get bored with eggs, especially with this homemade egg <br>
        soufflé recipe. It comes out so fluffy and delicious. Create a tasty brunch dish<br>
        by adding variations of ham, cheese, spinach, etc., all of your favorite ingredients.<br>
        I've adapted this recipe from Williams Sonoma Breakfast Cookbook.

    <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
    <!-- Using the unordered list (ul), we can list the items without numbers.-->
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter <i>(organic unsalted grass-fed butter recommended)</i></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons whole-wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>5 eggs <i>(local or organic pastured eggs recommended)</i></li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Method: </h2>
    <!-- Using an ordered list (ol), we can number our items, which is our steps in our procedure.  -->
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch round baking dish.</li>
        <li>Separate the eggs by placing the whites in a separate bowl from the yolks. <br>
            Whisk the egg whites with a mixer on high speed until soft peaks form (pictured) <br>
            and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once the foam has subsided,<br>
            whisk in the whole-wheat flour (this is called making a “roux”). Keep whisking<br>
            until the mixture begins to brown then turn the heat down to low and slowly add<br>
            the milk while still whisking constantly so lumps do not form. Turn it back up to<br> 
            medium and continue whisking until the milk mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and add 1/8 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Quickly<br>
            whisk the egg yolks into the milk mixture without allowing them to cook.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk/yolk mixture into the fluffy egg whites and using a rubber spatula<br>
            carefully fold the two together without crushing the air out of the egg whites.<br>
            Also add and mix in filling (like ham and/or cheese) if desired. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Scoop the mixture into the prepared baking dish and bake until lightly brown on <br>
            top, about 20 – 25 minutes. Serve immediately (otherwise the soufflé will “fall”).<br>
            Enjoy!</li>
